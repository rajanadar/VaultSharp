## 0.6.5-beta1 (Unreleased)

MISC:

DEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:

FEATURES:

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Add nonce to `SealStatus` type to allow seeing if the operation has reset. [https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2276/]
  * Add support for batch Transit operations:
    * `TransitEncryptAsync`

BUG FIXES:

## 0.6.4 (January 18, 2017)

MISC:

  * **VaultSharp 0.6.4 is now cross-platform! It supports .NET Standard 1.4 along with .NET 4.5.x and .NET 4.6.x.**
  * VaultSharp 0.6.4 is also strongly named now. This means your previous NuGet package may not automatically upgrade. 
    **YOU MAY NEED TO MANUALLY UPGRADE THE VAULTSHARP NUGET PACKAGE ONCE.**
  * Basically the change logs for  VaultSharp till 0.6.4 and follows the changelog 
    for Vault here. (https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
  * Some of the changes are called out below. But all of Vault 0.6.4 cumulative changes are supported by VaultSharp 0.6.4
  * A major breaking change in VaultSharp 0.6.4 is STRONG NAMING of VaultSharp. 
    Now both strong named and non-strong named assemblies can refer to VaultSharp. 
    This does mean that Nuget will not detect any upgrade from VaultSharp less than 0.6.4 to 0.6.4. You need to do this MANUALLY!

DEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:

  * VaultSharp 0.6.4 is also strongly named now. This means your previous NuGet package may not automatically upgrade. 
    **YOU MAY NEED TO MANUALLY UPGRADE THE VAULTSHARP NUGET PACKAGE ONCE.**
  * The `InitializeAsync` method now takes a single container object for all parameters, instead of primitive parameters.
    This single container object now has support for the additional recovery fields supported by Vault 0.6.2's initialization.
  * The File Audit backend path json key internally changed from `path` to `file_path`.
  * The `MongoDbGenerateDynamicCredentialsAsync` method now returns `MongoDbUsernamePasswordCredentials` instead of `UsernamePasswordCredentials`.
    This ensures you get the `database` field back as well.
  * The `MicrosoftSqlReadCredentialLeaseSettingsAsync` method now returns the `CredentialTimeToLiveSettings` instead of the deprecated `CredentialTtlSettings` type.
    This is in alignment with Vault deprecating `ttl_max` in favor of `max_ttl`.
  * VaultSharp 0.6.4 is now strongly named. This breaks compatibility between VaultSharp 0.6.1 and 0.6.4. 
    In fact, NuGet is going to treat them as 2 separate assemblies. I thought through a couple of options like
    releasing 2 NuGet packages and adding strongly named packages as part of a major version upgrade, but finally
    decided to just do it now and have just 1 Package.
    Because we are at the 0.x.x versions, I am thinking we can get away with this. :)
    A bit of pain now, for a lot less hassles later. (pretty much the whole conundrum of life!)
  * The `GetCallingTokenInfoAsync` now returns a new response type `CallingTokenInfo` instead of the previous `TokenInfo`.
    This supports the latest fields for Vault 0.6.4. [GH-18] 
  * The `TransitCreateEncryptionKeyAsync` now supports the `transitKeyType` parameter to specify the type of key needed.
  * The `TransitGetEncryptionKeyInfoAsync` method now returns `TransitEncryptionKeyInfo` with a lot more fields like `KeyDerivationFunction`, `ConvergentEncryptionVersion`, etc.

FEATURES:

  * New `/sys/wrapping` Apis: Wrap, Rewrap, Lookup and Unwrap.
  * The `UnwrapWrappedResponseDataAsync` method also supports a generic return type to give you strongly typed data back.
    So if you wrapped `AWSCredentials`, then you can unwrap `Secret<AWSCredentials>` instead of `Secret<Dictionary<string, object>>`.
    And at any time if you need the non-generic method, you can always fallback to the non-generic version returning a dictionary.
  * Add support for stored shares, recovery parameters etc. during the initialization of Vault.
  * Supports the new fields (`hmac_accessor`, `jsonx` format etc.) for File and SysLog Audit Backends.
  * The `AWSGenerateDynamicCredentialsWithSecurityTokenAsync` method now supports the `timeToLive` parameter.
  * The `Consul` backend now supports the listing functionality to roles `ConsulReadRoleListAsync`. (https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/2065)
  * The `Transit` backend now supports the new Apis for `List of keys`, `Random`, `Hash`, `Digest`, `Sign`, `Verify` etc.
  * All the secret backends now support wrapping of the secret into a cubbyhole token. Wrapping support added for:
    * AWS Secret Backend
    * Cassandra Secret Backend
    * Consul Secret Backend
    * Cubbyhole Secret Backend
    * Generic Secret Backend
    * MongoDB Secret Backend
    * Microsoft SQL Secret Backend
    * MySql Secret Backend
    * TBD for PKI Secret Backend
    * PostgreSQL Secret Backend
    * RabbitMQ Secret Backend
    * SSH Secret Backend
    * Transit Secret Backend

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Overall intellisense comments are updated to match the Vault documentation site.
  * The `CassandraRoleDefinition` now supports a consistency level parameter. (defaults to `Quorum`)
  * The `MongoDbGenerateDynamicCredentialsAsync` now returns the database name as well, related to the credentials. 
  * The `MySqlRoleDefinition` now supports the `RevocationSql` parameter to revoke an user.
  * Added `RevocationSql` parameter on the `PostgreSqlRoleDefinition` type to enable customization of user revocation SQL statements.
  * The WriteSecretAsync method now returns data if the underlying data allows for it. [GH-16]

BUG FIXES:

  * Fixed a race condition in the API calls to add the Vault Client Token Header. A single call involves removal and addition of the client token header. 
    Between the removal and addition, some other thread could make the API call, resulting in 401 errors. This is because the HttpClient is shared by all threads.
    The fallacy happens due to messing with Headers at the HttpClient level. 
    The fix was to compose a per thread HttpRequestMessage and set its headers. [GH-13](https://github.com/rajanadar/VaultSharp/issues/13)

## 0.6.1 (October 03, 2016)
